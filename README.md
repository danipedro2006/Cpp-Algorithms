## General info
In this repository, I'll break down what C++ game programming is by building some simple to complex games for begginer game programmer.

-Nim 

The game
Nim is a mathematical strategy game, where 2 players take turns taking items from distinct heaps. On your turn, you must take at least one item, and you may take as many as you want, provided that you only take from one heap. The player that takes the last item wins! This is a solved game. Before I go into the strategy, you can try playing it online here (http://www.goobix.com/games/nim/).

## Technologies
